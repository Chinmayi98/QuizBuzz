Some of the measures of quality are as follows.,
- Number of bugs per test=Total number of defects/Total number of tests
- Number of tests run per time period=Number of tests run/Total time
- Test design efficiency=Number of tests designed/Total time
- Bug find rate=Total number of defects/Total number of test hours
- Test review efficiency=Number of tests reviewed/Total time
- Passed Test Cases Percentage= (Number of Passed Tests/Total number of tests executed)*100
- Failed Test Cases Percentage= (Number of Failed Tests/Total number of tests executed)*100
- Fixed Defects Percentage= (Defects Fixed/Defects Reported)*100
- Critical Defects Percentage= (Critical Defects/Total Defects Reported)*100
- Rework Effort Ratio= (Actual rework efforts spent in that phase/total actual efforts spent in that phase)*100

Roles and responsibilities:

Name | Role | Quality Responsibility |
