# Project Quality Management Plan:

Quality Management Plan is about maintaining the quality throughout the project that is at deliverables and processes along with allocating the responsibility to different people in the project to meet the requirements of the clients. 

Metrics:

Some of the measures of quality are as follows.,
- Number of bugs per test=Total number of defects/Total number of tests
- Number of tests run per time period=Number of tests run/Total time
- Test design efficiency=Number of tests designed/Total time
- Bug find rate=Total number of defects/Total number of test hours
- Test review efficiency=Number of tests reviewed/Total time
- Passed Test Cases Percentage= (Number of Passed Tests/Total number of tests executed)*100
- Failed Test Cases Percentage= (Number of Failed Tests/Total number of tests executed)*100
- Fixed Defects Percentage= (Defects Fixed/Defects Reported)*100
- Critical Defects Percentage= (Critical Defects/Total Defects Reported)*100
- Rework Effort Ratio= (Actual rework efforts spent in that phase/total actual efforts spent in that phase)*100

- 1. Information to be communicated, including format, content, and level of detail :-

The information to be communicated for a project through email, seminars, conferences etc. The schedule for the communication plan can be created on Gantt Chart. The confidential information of the project can be shared through Google Docs and Github.

If the project team members will be in the same location then they need to communicate through the face-to-face meetings for better communication. If they are in different locations then they need to communicate through the video calls to rectify there errors when they run the code. Project status meetings are conducted on weekly basis and scrum meetings are held on daily basis with all the stakeholders.
